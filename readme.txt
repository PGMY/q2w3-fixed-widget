Fixes positioning of the selected widgets, when the page is scrolled down. 

== Description ==

Enable "Fixed widget" option in the widget settings (see [screenshot](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/q2w3-fixed-widget/screenshots/)) 
and it will be always in sight when page is scrolled down or up.

There is no problem to "Fix" or "Stick" more than one widget. 
Version 3.0 brings you a long waited capability to stick widgets located in different sidebars!

[Watch the demo](http://store.places-finder.com/cp-ajax-post-load).
Right sidebar, last three widgets. Scroll down to the bottom.

Compatibility note. The plugin is not working with all themes. Theme requirements:

* Widgets must have unique id attributes in html code (see [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/q2w3-fixed-widget/faq/)).
* jQuery 1.7 required. jQuery 1.8.3 (or later) is recommended.
* No JavaScript errors, coused by other plugins and scripts.
* `wp_head()` and `wp_footer()` functions in header.php and footer.php files.

In some cases (widget "jumping" during scroll and etc.) theme CSS changes may be required.

Supported languages: 

* English

== Installation ==

1. Follow standard WordPress plugin installation procedure
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. Go to Appearance -> Widgets, enable "Fixed Widget" option on any active widget ([screenshot](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/q2w3-fixed-widget/screenshots/)) 
4. Fine tune fixed widget margins on Appearance -> Fixed Widget Options page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why plugin is not working? =

There are several reasons:

1. Widgets have no unique IDs. How to check. Place two text widgets in your sidebar. Then look at html source of your site. If these two widgets have the same IDs (widget_text) or they have no IDs at all - that's the problem. How to fix. Find `register_sidebar()` function (look first at functions.php file). Parameter `before_widget` should be like this: `<li id="%1$s" class="widget-container %2$s">`. Attention to this part: `id="%1$s"`.    
2. Javascript errors on page. Commonly caused by buggy plugins. Check javascript console of your browser. If you find errors, try to locate and fix its source. 
3. No `wp_head()` and `wp_footer()` functions in template. Check header.php and footer.php files of your active theme.

= I have a responsive theme. How can I make the plugin compatible with it? =

For responsive compatibility I found only one approach: to disable plugin when mobile device detected or when browser window width is less then specified value.
There are several options to accomplish this task. The latest (and recommended!) is to enable "Screen Max Width" option. 
For example you have a responsive styles: `@media screen and (max-width: 940px) {...}`. Set "Screen Max Width" = 940 - to disable plugin in responsive mode. 
The other options are: "Disable plugin on mobile devices" and "Disable plugin on tablet devices". From version 3.0 these options are depricated and will be removed in the near future.  

= How to prevent overlapping with the footer? =

Make sure you have updated plugin to version 2.x. Go to WP admin area, Appearance -> Fixed Widget Options. Here you can define top and bottom margins. Set bottom margin value >= footer height. Check the result.

= Refresh Interval option =

This option defines (in milliseconds, 1 sec = 1000 ms) how often plugin recalculates sticky widgets parameters. Required by sites with dynamic content (infinite scroll, image lazy load and other javascript stuff). The option have impact on the site performance (client side). Recommended values: 250 - 1500 milliseconds. If you don't have dynamic content, set Refresh interval = 0.
